# SAviTraits_database
This database (SAviTraits 1.0) provides a compilation of species-specific dietary preferences and their known intra-annual variation for the world’s 10,715 species of birds. SAviTraits 1.0 uses dietary categories described by EltonTraits 1.0 (Wilman et al., 2014). Information on dietary preferences was obtained from the Handbook of the Birds of the World (HBOW) online database. Textual descriptions of species’ dietary preferences were translated into semi-quantitative information denoting the proportion of dietary categories utilized by each species. More details available in Murphy et al. (In review).
